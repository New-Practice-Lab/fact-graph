## What is the Fact Graph?

The Fact Graph is a production-ready knowledge graph for modeling, among other things, the United States Internal Revenue Code and related tax law.
It can be used in JavaScript as well as any JVM language (Java, Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, etc.).

## Onboarding and Set Up
See [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) for environment/developer setup.

See [the Fact Graph 3.1 ADR](docs/fact-graph-3.1-adr.md) for more information about the fact graph and how it has been changed since early 2025
See [here](docs/from-3.0-to-3.1.md) for a brief description of changes between the older versions of the Fact Graph and the current v3.1 in this repository 

## Contributing
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Demos
See [the demos folder and README](demo/README.md) for a list of simple
applications intended to demonstrate the Fact Graph's capabilities.

## Repository Update Frequency 

This repository is updated frequently. Development occurs in a private repository and approved changes to `main` are pushed to this repository in real-time.

## Useful documentation
* [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/) - the testing framework we use
* [scala-xml](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.19/scala-xml/scala/xml/) - the standard implementation of XML (don't be put off by the sparse-seeming API docs, the function definitions have very good examples)
