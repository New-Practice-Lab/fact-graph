# Fact Graph Demo

This directory contains web-based demos for the Fact Graph JavaScript library.

## Available Demos

1. **Get/set Fact Graph demo** (`get_set_demo/index.html`) - Included in the IRS original repo,
this is a general-purpose form for loading any fact dictionary and manually setting/getting facts. See [get_set_demo/GET-SET-README.md](./agi_demo/AGI-DEMO-README.md) for details.

2. **AGI Calculator demo** (`agi_demo/agi-demo.html`) - Calculator for computing Adjusted Gross Income. See [agi_demo/AGI-DEMO-README.md](./agi_demo/AGI-DEMO-README.md) for details.

3. **EITC eligibility checker** (`eitc_demo/eitc-demo.html`) - Eligibility checker for the Earned Income Tax Credit based on 2024 tax year rules. Demonstrates complex tax logic with income limits, age requirements, and filing status rules. See [eitc_demo/EITC-DEMO-README.md](./eitc_demo/EITC-DEMO-README.md) for details.

4. **Dinner check splitter demo** (`dinner_check_demo/dinner-check-demo.html`) - Bill-splitting calculator with birthday rule (intended to demo how the Fact Graph engine can work with
non-tax fact dictionaries). See [dinner_check_demo/DINNER-CHECK-README.md](./dinner_check_demo/DINNER-CHECK-README.md) for details.
